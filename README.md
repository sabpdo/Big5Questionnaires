# PsychoPy-Questionnaires


I recoded questionnaires into PsychoPy using Python. I specifically recoded the following questionnaires: Spatial Anxiey Scale, Risk Behavior Scale, and Big 5. 

The Spatial Anxiety Scale measures the level of anxiety one would experiment in eight situattions whcih are presumed to require spatial or navigaional skills. 
The Risk Behavior Scale records how likely participants are to participate in risky behavior and what they perceive as risky.
The Big 5 Questionnaire determines different values on thte domain and facet scales. Such items on the domain scale include extraversion, agreeableness,
and open-mindedness. Items on the facet scale include sociability, energy level, trust, organization, and other items.
